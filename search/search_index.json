With a highly replicated/distributed/loosely coupled microservice architecture it is not feasible to keep updating ports and IPs of services so that they can communicate to each other because usually this architecture is built to be ephemeral (meaning the microservices can go down, do rolling updates, scale up or down), so the number of services and their IPs can and will change, sometimes even minute to minute.

Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com because this is easier to remember a bunch of \"random\" numbers (IP addresses). But web browsers interact through IP addresses. So we have a middle man called DNS that translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load internet resources.</p> <p>Each device connected to the internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).</p> <p>Anyone that wants people to find and remember their website on the internet will need to set up DNS record(s).</p> <p>Generally DNS servers are meant to be used like chains: you have your authoritative DNS server which tells you the answer if it knows, if not it will ask the next one and that one will ask the next one etc. Having two DNS servers configured can lead to a situation where you might be asking about internal network from outside DNS servers.</p> <p>Info</p> <p>How DNS Works</p>"},{"location":"content/devops/networking/#glossary","title":"Glossary","text":"<p>A Record (aka Address Mapping Record, DNS host record) - The 'A' in A Record stands for 'address.' This is the most popular DNS record type. Its function? Connecting a website domain or subdomain names, such as  example.com or blog.example.com, to a numerical IPV4 address such as 127.0.0.1. Think of this as the home address of a website.</p> <p>AAAA Record - This behaves the same as the 'A' record but points the domain to an IPv6 address. The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the length of the IP address name from 32 bit to 128 bit consecutively. Because many domains use domain registrars, their nameservers have an IPv4 address, so an AAAA record is not present.</p> <p>CNAME Record - CNAME stands for \"canonical name\" and will always point one name used by a website to an A record.</p> <p>MX Record - A DNS 'mail exchange' (MX) record directs email to a mail server. The MX record indicates how email messages should be routed in accordance with the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP, the standard protocol for all email). Like CNAME records, an MX record must always point to another domain.</p> <p>SRV record - A service record (SRV) is a specification of data in the Domain Name System defining the location (i.e., the port number) of servers for specified services (e.g., Minecraft). Think of this as 'plugging in' a service to a port. TXT Record - Provides the ability to associate other services, or sometimes a mail service, to a domain. This is to help humans using words recognize which server (or software) is using their system. It's possible to add many TXT records to describe other numerical ideas.</p> <p>CERT Record - The 'certificate record' stores any public-key certificates. CERT records give the party in control of the authoritative DNS server for a specified zone permission to accept the use of a public key for authenticating communication with the server.</p> <p>PTR record - This 'pointer' record converts an IP address into a domain name. It's known as a reverse DNS entry check to verify if a server matches the domain it claims to be from. It's an extra check used as a security measure.</p> <p>SOA record - This record stores important information about the DNS zone for a domain, including the person responsible for the entire zone. Each zone must have an SOA record, but it's unlikely you'll have to create an SOA record directly\u2014unless the responsible person is you. An interesting thing about SOA records is they are always distributed with a zero TTL to prohibit caching. This record cannot be adjusted or interfered with but is limited to traveling only to one server at a time.</p> <p>CAA record - As a domain name holder, this helps you specify which Certification Authorities (CAs) can issue certificates for your domain, avoiding that error message 'this site does not have a valid certificate.'</p> <p>ALIAS record - ALIAS is a hosting record which points one domain to another domain. Usually, a CNAME record takes priority over any other resource record for a given hostname and conflicts with such records as MX or TXT, and thus some services may be affected and will not work. Thus ALIAS (also known as a virtual host record) was introduced. It can coexist with other records which are created for the same hostname (like example.com).</p>"},{"location":"content/devops/nomad/","title":"Hashicorp Nomad","text":"<p>Info</p> <p>Nomad Homepage | Nomad Docs | Cloud Native Landscape</p> <p>Nomad is a flexible workload orchestrator that enables an organization to easily deploy and manage any containerized or legacy application using a single, unified workflow.

The company's motivation is to make more money, that means reducing operating costs which in itself means making the tasks of the employees easier and more efficient. That is to say that our goal is to make our jobs as easy and efficient as possible. At first, this company was still using faxes and all the accounting was done on paper. But we built this wonderful web app for storing the companies documents (called Document Webapp) so the company can stop renting a whole warehouse for storing and handling physical stacks of paper. For the Document Webapp there was no other product that fit our company so we coded it ourselves in your favorite programming language. We ended up with a single executable that we test on the Test Server and run on the Production Server. Both servers are identical and run the same OS (let's call it the OldOS 1), same everything to ensure that there are no surprises, because when the intern tried to run it on his laptop with a different OS he got a lot of weird errors.</p> <p>By building this Document Webapp we reduced the costs by making the tasks of the employees easier and more efficient. But now instead of all the people at the document warehouse, we are managing the Document Webapp. We don't have to do as much work as all the people handling the paper did combined, but it's a lot of work to manage the Document Webapp so we would like to make OUR jobs easier and more efficient, so let's see what we could do.</p> <p>Let's look at the Document Webapp in detail. Because it's a web app it is using our companies load balancers (also acting as reverse proxies) so users can access it from the internet, fortunately load balancers are separate from our app and are taken care for us. But we coded our own:</p> <ul> <li>Web front-end</li> <li>Document Database (to store our documents)</li> <li>Document Search (so clients can search for documents without scrolling through a list of them)</li> <li>Document Caching (so the documents are delivered efficiently to clients)</li> <li>Authentication System (to provide logins and private documents for clients)</li> <li>Web back-end (to tie all the previous systems together)</li> </ul> <p>And the components of the app run inside that one executable!</p> <p>When we want to run a new version the the Document Webapp here's our deployment process at this point:</p> <ol> <li>SSH into the Test server</li> <li>Stop the Document Webapp</li> <li>Clone and build the latest Document Webapp</li> <li>Update the system packages if needed</li> <li>Start the new Document Webapp</li> <li>Repeat the same in the Production Server</li> </ol> <p>Quite simple! But we can automate that, so we run the same steps with Ansible. Even better! Now our process looks like this:</p> <ol> <li>Update Ansible repository with the version of the Document Webapp and version of the system dependencies we want to deploy</li> <li>Ansible runs the following automatically on the Test server:<ol> <li>Stop the Document Webapp</li> <li>Clone and build the latest Document Webapp</li> <li>Update the system packages if needed</li> <li>Start the new Document Webapp</li> </ol> </li> <li>Repeat the same for Production Server</li> </ol> <p>By doing all this, manually or with Ansible, the application is tied to the host that we run it on and the hosts OS. That is to say, if the OS or the hardware of the host has issues then our app will also be affected. Transferring the app to a new host means adding a new host in Ansible with the same OS and letting Ansible configure it with our dependencies and the Document Webapp.</p>"},{"location":"content/devops/orchestrationexplained/#meet-the-container","title":"Meet The Container","text":"<p>Then one day, it turns out we need to upgrade all our servers' OS from OldOS 1 to OldOS 2 because the previous version is now no longer supported and does no longer get security patches. Remember when our intern tried to run the Document Webapp on his laptop with a different OS got a lot of weird errors? Well now we are facing the same problem, because the application is tied to the OS. But can we somehow isolate Document Webapp so that it is able to run on any machine? The answer is application containers!</p> <p>Containerization is having the operating system take features and properties normally considered global, and reduce them to private versions or limited access/resources as a means of restricting or isolating access to those resources. Note that it's not the same as running another virtual machine (VM). VMs isolate on the kernel level, containers isolate on the OS level. Furthermore, there is a difference between system containers and application containers. System containers take the place of VMs when there is no need to isolate on the kernel level, because they have less overhead because of not having to simulate the kernel. System containers are usually used as you would use a VM. However application containers are designed to only run a single process and only contain bare minimum of the OS dependencies that the said singular process needs. Application containers are designed to be treated as you would treat the executable without containerization. You're not supposed to remote into the container, run commands and install stuff in the container, they're not supposed to have their own IP address etc. If you need to modify the container, you stop the old one and launch a new one with the modified contents. To put it simply application containers are emphemeral and system containers (like VMs) are long-lasting.</p> <p>But we are storing documents on our app, how can it be ephemeral? We certainly do not want the data to be ephemeral, otherwise on each restart of the container we would lose our data! This is key point to understand: application containers need to be provided with a separate persistent storage that is not part of the container itself. Simplest solution is to mount a directory from the host into the container. So on each restart the container uses the same data directory and our data is long-lasting while our container is ephemeral!</p> <p>Going forward if I mention containers, I mean application containers not system containers.</p> <p>So we create our container image for our Document Webapp. After creating the container image and launching a container with that image we will have it running on the servers with OldOS 2 inside a container that runs the Document Webapp executable with only the bare minimum dependencies from OldOS 1. In fact if the intern tries to run the Document Webapp now, then using the container they will not have any problems with their OS! With the container we have isolated the app from the OS of the host we are running it on.</p> <p>Now our process looks like this:</p> <ol> <li>Update Ansible repository with the version of the Document Webapp container image we want to deploy</li> <li>Ansible runs the following automatically on the Test server:<ol> <li>Stop the old Document Webapp container</li> <li>Start the new Document Webapp container</li> </ol> </li> <li>Repeat the same for Production Server</li> </ol> <p>At this point the containerized app is still dependent on the host we are running it on though! If there are issues on the hosts OS then our app will not be affected (unless it's serious), but if the hardware of the host has issues then our app will still be affected.</p>"},{"location":"content/devops/orchestrationexplained/#meet-the-orchestrator","title":"Meet The Orchestrator","text":"<p>Then at some point the Test server dies and it becomes the center of attention because what if this were to happen to Production? Management and we want to make sure that this absolutely does not happen to the Production Server. We could run a couple more Production servers for high availability and have a load balancer in front of them. This is certainly a good solution, but adds management overhead since now we have to manage multiple servers. Since we are already using containers, let's use an orchestrator!</p> <p>With an orchestrator we can set up a number of hosts in a cluster and then specify how many instances should be running and how these instances should be running and the orchestrator will take care of everything. However this comes with some new challenges as now where the Document Webapp is running becomes dynamic. The orchestrator will decide on it's own where it wants to run it and where it is the most efficient.</p> <p>Where the services are running, which port they are running on will all be dynamic with an orchestrator. The dynamic nature of orchestrating means we have to adapt our thinking and infrastructure to handle everything being dynamic. This means figuring out how to:</p> <ul> <li>load balance and direct traffic to the services (often called ingress): how do we direct traffic to instance(s) of our service if we don't know the host it is running on?</li> <li>handle logging and aggregating logs for easier debugging: how do we know which instance had a problem, how do we know it was the orchestrator, where are all the logs located?</li> <li>manage TLS certificates: it is not possible or good practice to spam certificate requests for all nodes, how do we distribute them?</li> <li>cluster internal communication: if services are running on arbitrary ports, how can they communicate with each other?</li> <li>handle stateful storage: if the service can run on any host, how do we ensure it will always have the same data?</li> </ul> <p>These are non-trivial obstacles, but once solved the Document Webapp service(s) can be separated from the host(s) it is running on with an orchestrator. It will no longer matter where it is, the orchestrator will make sure the defined number of instances will be up if enough nodes in the cluster are alive. If one dies with a service running on it, the orchestrator will deploy a new instance on another host et voila, it's as easy as that!</p> <p>Now our process looks like this:</p> <ol> <li>Define to the orchestrator how Document Webapp should be run and how many instances should be deployed</li> <li>Orchestrator will compare current state to defined state and do the following:<ol> <li>Check version and do a rolling update if current is outdated</li> <li>Check how many instances are running, stops or starts new instances to match defined state</li> <li>Takes care of load balancing, storage, certs</li> <li>Reports health of defined services</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>The orchestrator will get us as close to true Infrastructure as Code as today's technology allows.

No, it's not quite as fast as a single, truly contiguous write... but the 1MiB blocksize is large enough that it's quite close. Besides, if literally any other disk activity is requested simultaneously with a contiguous write, the \"contiguous\" write devolves to this level of performance pretty much instantly, so this is a much more realistic test of the upper end of storage performance on a typical system.</p> <p>You'll see some kooky fluctuations on SSDs when doing this test. This is largely due to the SSD's firmware having better luck or worse luck at any given time, when it's trying to queue operations so that it can write across all physical media stripes cleanly at once. Rust disks will tend to provide a much more consistent, though typically lower, throughput across the run.</p> <p>You can also see SSD performance fall off a cliff here if you exhaust an onboard write cache\u2014TLC and QLC drives tend to have small write cache areas made of much faster MLC or SLC media.

Thus handling variables becomes really important. Saltstack is more more explicit ways in which it handles variables: they're defined in a pillar. Contrast this with the variable precedence for Ansible (there's a hierarchy of 22 different variable locations). Usually with Ansible an admin will usually only have to think about 4 different variable locations (command line, hostgroup, host and role variables), but the requirement to always needing to consider and build playbooks around variable precedence makes for less readable and harder to maintain repos.</p> <p>Secondly, Saltstack uses master-agent architecture over Ansible's much much easier to get started with agentless approach. However, as a result, it tends not to scale as well as Saltstack because you have to open an SSH connection to every machine you want to manage. Saltstack, by contrast, uses ZeroMQ to communicate with minions: minions listen for instructions on one ZeroMQ port on the master (4505) and post back results on another (4506). It's blazing fast and it scales really well. Works even when SSH goes down or the machines don't expose ssh (e.g. locked down machines that do not need SSH). Worth noting that in terms of actually writing tasks for minions, they are very similar and both use YAML and Jinja, so in that sense they are both as easy to onboard new people for writing new tasks. The learning curve increase for Saltstack comes from the initial master-minion setup, but even that is not a hugely complicated job all things considered.</p> <p>Thirdly, master-agent architecture of Salt enables true event driven management with reactors which is especially good for dynamic host inventories (with hosts that often power on and off like gray nodes). So we could much easily define scenarios for minion wakeups.</p> <p>For notifications, Ansible has easier integration for sending emails however if we split the runs (by hostgroup) then that means an email for each hostgroup. Aggregating errors will become a problem that needs a custom script. For Salt aggregating results and more granular control over notifications needs more work, but is a lot more flexible and does not need custom scripts.</p>"},{"location":"content/devops/saltstack-for-ansible/#points-for-ansible-and-against-salt","title":"Points for Ansible and against Salt","text":"<p>The support for Ansible is a lot better, there are more people using it in both enterprise and open source. Community is also a lot bigger. Having such a big user base behind them gives Ansible much stable and reliable updates compared to Salt where looking at the best practices even from 3 years ago differ from the ones recommended today.</p> <p>Even if on paper SaltStack seems a lot better in many aspects on paper, in reality there are quite a few worrying problems. Like the git filesystem. It is possible to use <code>gitfs</code> alongside the default <code>rootfs</code> to automatically fetch Salt formulas, pillars etc from remote git repos, however <code>gitfs</code> is unfortunately buggy and full of python version mismatch errors among other things (Check the warnings in the <code>gitfs</code> documentation). Basic things like version controlling config management should be reliable and it begs the question of what else might be buggy in Salt.</p> <p>Even variable handling gets messy when moving away from pillar only setups where you have to merge pillars with defaults and use map files in formulas which one might have to do to keep SaltStack performant when managing a large number of minions. Here's where the Ansible variable precedence actually comes in handy, because you can just define variables in the playbook and not have to worry about merging them.</p>"},{"location":"content/devops/saltstack-for-ansible/#further-resources-for-saltstack","title":"Further resources for Saltstack","text":"<ul> <li>Salt In 10 Minutes Walkthrough</li> <li>Salt User Guide</li> <li>Salt Documentation</li> <li>SaltStack Configuration Management Best Practices</li> </ul>"},{"location":"content/devops/semver/","title":"Automated releases & commit styles","text":"<p>In the ideal environment the developer only needs to commit changes in the correct format and everything else about the release process is done automatically and programatically, not romantically and sentimentally.</p> <p>For the accadmlib and accadmlibclient projects the python-semantic-release tool was implemented to try and unify commit styles as well as make automate the release procedure of Python packages in tandem with the acc-py devtools templates.</p> <p>Advantages of using python-semantic-release is that it can do the following automatically:</p> <ul> <li>Parse commits and decide which version to bump to</li> <li>Parse commits and generate a Changelog</li> <li>Change version variables in multiple locations (typically <code>setup.py</code> and <code>docs/conf.py</code>)</li> <li>Create a tag for the release</li> <li>Pushe changelog and source to GitLab project Releases (in the future will also be possible to push dist and wheel to the releases if needed)</li> </ul> <p>Advantages of using acc-py devtools python CI templates is that it can do the following automatically:</p> <ul> <li>Run unittests if they exist</li> <li>Try to install it in a docker according to ACC-Py Package Index requirements</li> <li>Build Sphinx documentation and upload it to <code>[https://acc-py.web.cern.ch/gitlab/&lt;group&gt;/&lt;project&gt;/docs/master/](https://acc-py.web.cern.ch/gitlab/acc-adm/accadmlib/docs/master/)</code></li> <li>Upload dist and wheel to ACC-Py Package Index when a tag is pushed to project repository</li> </ul>"},{"location":"content/devops/semver/#commit-style-scipy","title":"Commit style: SciPy","text":"<p>python-semantic-release provides parsers for 3 commit styles (and an option to write a custom parser), of which it was decided to move forward by using the SciPy style.</p> <p>Commit messages using SciPy tags in the following template:</p> Text Only<pre><code>&lt;tag&gt;(&lt;scope&gt;): &lt;subject&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>While <code>&lt;scope&gt;</code> is supported here it isn\u2019t actually part of the SciPy style.

It works with a number of different databases through a plugin interface. There are a number of built-in database types, and an exposed framework for running custom database types for extendability. This means that services that need to access a database no longer need to hardcode credentials: they can request them from Vault, and use Vault's leasing mechanism to more easily roll keys. These are referred to as \"dynamic roles\" or \"dynamic secrets\".</p> <p>Since every service is accessing the database with unique credentials, it makes auditing much easier when questionable data access is discovered. You can track it down to the specific instance of a service based on the SQL username.</p> <p>PKI Secrets Engine</p> <p>The PKI secrets engine generates dynamic X.509 certificates. With this secrets engine, services can get certificates without going through the usual manual process of generating a private key and CSR, submitting to a CA, and waiting for a verification and signing process to complete. Vault's built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms provide the verification functionality.</p> <p>By keeping TTLs relatively short, revocations are less likely to be needed, keeping CRLs short and helping the secrets engine scale to large workloads. This in turn allows each instance of a running application to have a unique certificate, eliminating sharing and the accompanying pain of revocation and rollover.</p> <p>In addition, by allowing revocation to mostly be forgone, this secrets engine allows for ephemeral certificates. Certificates can be fetched and stored in memory upon application startup and discarded upon shutdown, without ever being written to disk.</p> <p>Transit Secrets Engine</p> <p>The transit secrets engine handles cryptographic functions on data in-transit. Vault doesn't store the data sent to the secrets engine. It can also be viewed as \"cryptography as a service\" or \"encryption as a service\".

It does this by binding to receptors in your brain. Most notably ethanol binds to glutamate neurotransmitters, which in turn causes the brain to respond slower to stimuli. Along with glutamate neurotransmitters there are several other receptors that ethanol binds with that slows brain function. The result of these inhibited receptors is what we call drunkenness. The reversal of this process can take a while, and the hangover that ensues after a heavy night of drinking is a mix of your body trying to get rid of the ethanol and other harmful molecules, along with dehydration. Unfortunately, if enough ethanol builds up in your system, it can kill you. To be clear, most doctors and scientists agree that occasionally drinking alcohol poses very minimal health risks. In fact, consuming alcohol in moderation may have some health benefits. However, health problems arise when overconsumption occurs.</p>"},{"location":"content/food/body-when-you-stop-drinking-alcohol/#recovery-timeline-from-alcohol","title":"Recovery timeline from alcohol","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Seconds after - you stop drinking, your liver slowly filters out the toxins and sugars found in the alcohol.</p> </li> <li> <p>An hour - your body has filtered your blood several times and metabolized the drinks you\u2019ve had and your body starts to feel tired due to the high amount of energy it uses to remove the alcohol from your blood. The time it takes your body to break down the alcohol directly correlates to the amount consumed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Six hours - time for your body to completely break down all the ethanol in your system and bring the sugar, water, and other nutrient levels back to normal, the lingering effects of drunkenness will persist. After you\u2019ve had your last sip of alcohol your body needs more rest than usual to recover from your attempts to poison it. Unfortunately, until you get past this stage, it is difficult to have a good night\u2019s sleep. In fact, recent research suggests that alcohol actually increases alpha wave patterns in the brain, which are only supposed to be present while you\u2019re awake. This implies that alcohol tricks the brain into thinking the body is awake when it is really trying to sleep.</p> </li> <li> <p>6 to 12 hours - your body physically starts to change for the better. For one thing, alcohol has been shown to weaken your immune system. This may leave you susceptible to viruses and bacteria that are present at bars and parties.</p> </li> <li> <p>24 hours - your immune system returns to normal.</p> </li> <li> <p>3 to 5 days - you may find that your blood pressure begins to drop and you will overall feel less stressed. Doctors often recommend that people with high blood pressure reduce the amount of alcohol they consume, so even if this is not your goal, less than a week after you stop drinking your body will be grateful for the much needed break. You might also notice your appetite begins to decrease about a week after you stop consuming alcohol. This is one of the reasons that people tend to lose weight when they quit drinking. The other reason is that on average each drink you\u2019re consuming contains a couple of hundred calories. And since the sugars in alcohol don't break down in your body very well, much of it gets stored as fat. If you can give up drinking for an entire week you may also find your skin looks and feels better. This is because your body is now more hydrated. Not only does alcohol make you pee more often, but it also decreases your antidiuretic hormone levels, which play a role in allowing your body to reabsorb water.</p> </li> <li> <p>7 days - hormone levels are back to normal and your body is retaining more water. This is good not only for your skin but for your body overall.</p> </li> <li> <p>2 weeks - without alcohol you may find your cognitive abilities start to improve and without the pressure of filtering alcohol, your kidneys will begin to repair themselves. This is because the brain, like many parts of your body, is resilient. The damage done to your neural pathway by the ethanol can be reversed. You will never regain memories from when you blacked out while drinking or recover thoughts that were obliterated from overconsumption of alcohol, but many of your neural connections will heal themselves over the coming weeks and months. Like the liver, the kidneys filter out toxins. They are not quite as affected by alcohol as the liver is, but overconsumption can definitely cause damage over time. After a couple of weeks of no drinking, the kidneys will heal enough to maintain proper fluid levels, waste excretion, and hormone balances.</p> </li> <li> <p>3 weeks to a month - the liver will repair itself and tissue will start to regenerate fully. The organ that takes the brunt of the damage when you drink is the liver. It is a vital structure and without it, you can\u2019t survive. Without having to worry about alcohol, your liver can focus on breaking down other toxins that are produced by the body, which overall will make you feel healthier.</p> </li> <li> <p>1 to 2 months - your liver will be working at full power again. Just reducing the amount of alcohol you consume on a weekly basis can be beneficial for your liver. Too much drinking can also damage your heart and increase your chances of having a heart attack or a stroke. Around two months after you stop drinking your heart will have repaired most of the damage caused by overconsumption of alcohol.</p> </li> <li> <p>More than 2 months - your body may feel a better in a multitude of ways due to a combination of less stress and allowing your organs to repair themselves. Interestingly, stress has very similar effects on the body as alcohol does. It can increase blood pressure, cause heart problems, negatively affect your skin, and cause depression. One of the most surprising changes to your body after you stop drinking happens without you even feeling anything. The research suggests that people who consume large amounts of alcohol are at higher risk for certain types of cancer, which makes sense when you think about it. Since your body technically sees alcohol as a toxin, and your liver is responsible for removing that toxin, it is no surprise that people who are heavy drinkers have a high risk of developing liver cancer. This means that once you stop drinking, you are actually lowering the chances of your body developing cancer.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"content/food/body-when-you-stop-drinking-alcohol/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/ss/slideshow-quit-alcohol-effects</li> <li>https://www.healthline.com/health-news/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-quit-alcohol-for-30-days</li> <li>https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19532341/what-happens-when-you-stop-drinking-alcohol/</li> <li>https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/alcohol-use/news/news/2020/04/alcohol-does-not-protect-against-covid-19-access-should-be-restricted-during-lockdown#:~:text=Alcohol%20consumption%20is%20associated%20with,COVID%2D19%20pandemic.</li> <li>https://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/drugs-alcohol/how-alcohol-makes-drunk.htm</li> <li>https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-alcohol-affects-your-kidney-health/</li> </ul>"},{"location":"content/food/desserts/","title":"Desserts","text":"<p>Collection of dessert recipes.</p>"},{"location":"content/food/desserts/#curd-dessert-with-roasted-oatmeal","title":"Curd Dessert with Roasted Oatmeal","text":"<p>Ingredients</p> <ul> <li>200 ml heavy cream</li> <li>3 tbsp sugar</li> <li>1 tsp vanilla sugar</li> <li>400 g curd paste (kohupiimapasta)</li> <li>3 tbsp roasted barley flour (kama)</li> <li>1 tsp freshly squeezed lemon juice</li> </ul> <p>Creamy Cottage Cheese Dessert Instructions:</p> <ol> <li>Whip the heavy cream with sugar and vanilla sugar</li> <li>Mix in the curd paste and roasted barley flour (kama) gradually while stirring</li> <li>Sprinkle some lemon juice over the barley mixture for enhanced flavor</li> <li>Divide the mixture into serving dishes and serve</li> </ol> <p>Roasted Oatmeal Ingredients</p> <ul> <li>100 g oatmeal</li> <li>1-2 tbsp butter</li> <li>1-2 tbsp sugar</li> </ul> <p>Roasted Oatmeal Instructions:</p> <ol> <li>Heat a pan over medium heat, add rolled oats and butter, and toast for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until the oats turn golden brown.

The salt will release moisture from the eggplants and allow them to cook quicker in the oven.  Using a paper towel, pat dry the eggplants with a wiping action to remove some of the salt before roasting.</li> <li>The texture of the caponata is really a personal preference. If you like it on the softer side, saute the veggies a little bit longer and/or cut them smaller.  Conversely, just cook them for a few minutes if you want the celery and onion crunch.</li> </ul> <p>Possible additions:</p> <ul> <li>Add some zucchini to this caponata for a nice twist.</li> <li>Use 1-2 large bell peppers, cut up into bite-size chunks for added texture and flavor.</li> <li>Roast 1 cup of carrots with the eggplant for added flavor or just sear them in the pan with the onions and celery to introduce a crunchy texture.</li> <li>Saute 3-4 chopped anchovies until they melt with the celery and onion.</li> <li>Mint and basil are excellent additions!</li> </ul> <p>Instructions:</p> <ol> <li>Preheat oven to 425F and begin by cutting 2 pounds of eggplant into approximately 1\u2033 cubes.</li> <li>Place all the cut eggplant into a large glass bowl and toss with a 1/2 cup of olive oil, a tsp of kosher salt and a 1/2 tsp of black pepper.  Use enough oil to coat all the pieces.</li> <li>On a large baking sheet (line it with parchment paper to avoid sticking) spread out the eggplant. Keep the pieces from touching and if necessary use 2 sheet pans.  Place the eggplant on the middle oven rack and roast for 25-30 minutes.</li> <li>While the eggplant is roasting begin cutting 1 cup of celery into smallish pieces like shown.</li> <li>Cut 1 cup of onion into half-moon strips.  You can cut the onion and celery any way you want!  Some people like a chunkier caponata while others prefer a smoother one.</li> <li>Toast a 1/4 cup of pignoli (pine) nuts in a separate pan over medium-low heat for 5 minutes or so.  Be careful, they burn easily.  When finished toasting, remove the nuts and set them aside.</li> <li>In a large pan saute the onion and celery for a few minutes in a 1/4 cup of olive oil over medium heat.

Use a fork and make sure they are soft on the inside and fully cooked.  If not, another 5 minutes in the oven is fine.</li> <li>To the pan add 1 cup of pitted good quality green olives, an 1/8 cup of rinsed capers  Also, add 1 Tbsp of sugar and a 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar.  Cook for 5 minutes stirring occasionally to avoid sticking.</li> <li>Add in the eggplant and pine nuts and cook for 3 more minutes to ensure the caponata is well mixed.  Be careful while mixing in the eggplant to avoid mashing it too much.  A gentle stir with a wooden spoon is all that\u2019s required.</li> <li>Finally, add a 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley, give it one more stir, and a taste test.

It is primarily intended for IT professionals, who use it for application deployment, updates on workstations and servers, cloud provisioning, configuration management, intra-service orchestration, and nearly anything a systems administrator does on a weekly or daily basis. Ansible doesn't depend on agent software and has no additional security infrastructure, so it's easy to deploy.</p> <p>For the best guide for deep diving into using Ansible check out Jeff Geerling's Ansible Guide if you like video format or Fast Ansible Guide if you prefer text.</p> <p>For configuration management it made sense to go with something simple to ease bootstrapping and favoring mutability for fastest development. Running a whole platform like Puppet did not make sense because of bootstrapping and resource overhead. Ansible is simple to write, understand and manage if written well from the get-go. I also tried SaltStack, but in the end it had too many shortcomings, check out the conclusions of the Ansible User's Guide to Saltstack page.</p> <p>Also knowing Ansible I knew how slow it can be. There's two ways of solving this: using push mode with a central management (with homebrew solutions or AWX/Ansible Tower) with parallel playbook execution for each host OR pull mode where each host essentially configures itself. Running AWX/Ansible Tower has the same problem of bootstrapping and resource overhead. Homebrew parallel push system spikes the central management resource usage when executed and requires you to be on two hosts (central management host and the host being configured) when developing. It is quite evident that pull mode is the more scalable, resource efficient and easier for swift changes, although because of it's outside-in nature it is less secure. I've tried and used both, but went back to push mode using ansible-parallel.</p> <p>I settled on the following requirements:</p> <ul> <li>Easy to bootstrap (i.e. couple of commands excluding secrets)</li> <li>Scalable (execution time does not depend on the number of hosts)</li> <li>Simple to modify and manage (DRY monorepo for all hosts)</li> <li>No single point of failure in the form of a centralized configuration bastion</li> </ul> <p>The solution was jamlab-ansible: Homelab push-mode configuration management with Ansible.</p>"},{"location":"content/homelab/ansible/#ansible-best-practices","title":"Ansible Best Practices","text":""},{"location":"content/homelab/ansible/#idempotency","title":"Idempotency","text":"<p>The most important thing about using Ansible is that all tasks should be idempotent. It means that each time any task is run, the result of it should be the same regardless of any state on the machine it is run on. For example if you want to install some package on a host with ansible and use the ansible.builtin.shell module for it with some command. Maybe it will succeed the first time but give an error when the package is already installed.</p> <p>Instead of ansible.builtin.shell module we should use purpose built Ansible modules if they exist since they will make sure that the result is idempotent. However you can make shell tasks idempotent as well with some workarounds. For example consider the following very common trick of registering outputs from tasks:</p> YAML<pre><code># First we check if a directory for CNI exists.\n- name: Check if cni exists\nansible.builtin.stat:\n    path: /opt/cni/bin/bridge\nregister: r_cni # Then we register the output of this task in a variable called \"r_cni\" (using r_ prefix is an old convention)\n\n# Check if newer CNI exists IF the directory in the last task did exist, check \"when\" key at the bottom of this task\n- name: Check if newer cni exists \nansible.builtin.shell: |\n    latest_tag=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/containernetworking/plugins/releases/latest | jq -r \".tag_name\")\n    current_ver=$(/opt/cni/bin/bridge 2&gt;&amp;1 | cut -d \" \" -f 4)\n    case \"$current_ver\" in ${latest_tag} ) echo \"latest\";; *) echo \"outdated\";; esac\nregister: r_cni_ver # We register the output of our commands which in this case is either \"lastest\" or \"outdated\" we will use this for handling the cases in the next task\nwhen: r_cni.stat.exists # We only run this task if the output of the last task says that the directory did exist\n\n# Get the latest CNI if the output of the last task was not \"latest\", check \"when\" key at the bottom of this task\n- name: Get latest cni\nansible.builtin.shell: |\n    latest_tag=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/containernetworking/plugins/releases/latest | jq -r \".tag_name\")\n    latest_url=https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/${latest_tag}/cni-plugins-linux-amd64-${latest_tag}.tgz\n    wget -P /tmp $latest_url\n    mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin\n    tar -C /opt/cni/bin -xzf /tmp/\"${latest_url##*/}\"\n    rm /tmp/\"${latest_url##*/}\"\nwhen: not r_cni.stat.exists or r_cni_ver.stdout != \"latest\" # We run this task if CNI directory does not exist or when the output of the last task was not \"latest\"\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"content/homelab/ansible/#readability","title":"Readability","text":"<p>The second most important thing about using Ansible is always being explicit. For example when using modules, it is better to write \"ansible.builtin.shell\" instead of \"shell\".

This why it is not native behavior in Ansible to combine dicts and lists from different \"variables\" or \"defaults\" files. Instead the variables will follow a precedence and overwrite the one before it. Usually this follows the pattern of (weakest to strongest precedence): global variables, group variables, host variables.

Then the master playbook runs all the other playbooks that define which roles are run on which hosts or host groups. This introduces a problem where a breaking change in one role will halt the whole run. Also, even with well organized root playbooks, it is never immediately obvious which roles are defined for which root playbooks especially if using hosts in multiple groups or child/parent groups. Furthermore, the root playbooks, <code>group_vars/</code> and <code>host_vars/</code> are in separate directories which is not a huge deal, but this does require one to verify that root playbooks, variables and roles match when planning changes. This requires extra time of getting familiar with what-goes-where especially when doing changes after a long time. For larger projects usually the roles are managed in and imported from separate repositories. It is a great approach, especially for running tests on the roles. However this increases the time of understanding what-goes-where.</p> <p>These are small nitpicks and for most use cases following the standard structure works well, but for maximum simplicity I grew very fond of a system for pull mode Ansible we used at CERN. An example structure for this system looks something like this:</p> Bash<pre><code>ansible.cfg                 # ansible configuration file\nhosts                       # inventory file\n\nbin/                        # binaries\n    bootstrap.sh            # script for setting up host for the first time\n    run-playbooks.sh        # script for running relevant playbooks locally on host\n\nplaybooks/                  # \"root\" playbook directory\n    group_base/             # \"\"\n        main.yml            # here we define roles for a particular group\n        group_vars/         # \"\"\n            all.yml         # here we assign variables to a particular group\n        host_vars/          # \"\"\n            &lt;hostname&gt;.yml  # here we assign variables to a particular host\n    host_&lt;hostname&gt;/        # here we define roles for a particular host\n        main.yml            # define roles for a particular host\n        host_vars/          # \"\"\n            &lt;hostname&gt;.yml  # here we assign variables to a particular host\n    function_test/          # \"\"\n        main.yml            # \"\"\n\nroles/                      # roles directory\n    &lt;role&gt;/                 # role name \n        defaults/           # \"\"\n            main.yml        # &lt;-- default lower priority variables for this role\n        files/              # \"\"\n            file.txt        # &lt;-- files\n            template.txt.j2 # &lt;-- files for use with the template resource\n        tasks/              # \"\"\n            main.yml        # &lt;-- tasks to run for the role\n</code></pre> <p>With this system root playbooks are separated into directories with their own variables and are not run from a single master playbook thus each play can run regardless of whether there are errors in other playbooks. Each playbook only defines which roles to run on the host group and nothing else, for example:</p> YAML<pre><code>- name: PLAYBOOK FOR GROUP 'GGG'\n  hosts: ggg\n\n  roles:\n\n  - { role: pre, tags: [ pre ], when: not (disabled_roles.pre | default(false)) }\n\n  - { role: rrr, tags: [ rrr ], when: not (disabled_roles.rrr | default(false)) }\n\n  - { role: post, tags: [ post ], when: not (disabled_roles.post | default(false)) }\n</code></pre> <p>This and it's accompanying variables file make it simple to understand at a glance which roles are run and where the group variables are defined since they are all together in one directory.</p> <p>For maximum simplicity for managing the playbooks and roles it should be enforced that each host is only part of ONE group. This will ensure that it will always be immediately obvious which playbooks are run for what host when looking at the inventory file.</p>"},{"location":"content/homelab/dl380g9/","title":"Configuring HP DL380 G9","text":"<p>Done</p> <p>Decomissioned in 10.09.2025, after ~4 years at CERN and ~3 years in the homelab.

Which in my case amounted to 2 CPUs and then 8 disks since I only had one of the three possible drive bays installed on the board.</p> <p>For RAM, however nice it sounded to fill all 24 slots and enjoy 384GB of memory, there was some additional consideration since these CPUs each have four independent memory channels. For best performance, all four memory channels of each CPU should be populated with identical DIMM setup to allow parallel access across the entire memory bus. This means installing 8, 16, or 24 DIMMs total. However populating all three sockets per memory channel, i.e. all 24 slots, memory controller significantly lowers the frequency as detailed in NUMA Deep Dive Part 4: Local Memory Optimization.</p> <p>As more ranks are used in a memory channel, memory speed is dropped to make up for the management overhead. Therefore in certain configurations, DIMMs will run slower than their listed maximum speeds. This is also documented in DL380 G9 User Manual:</p> <p></p> <p>Using 24x16GB would drop the memory speed from 2133MHz to 1600MHz, a quite significant drop. Assuming that I wanted to run some game servers on this server I went with lower capacity, 16x16GB, and thus with higher speed thinking that 8 cores split over 8 VMs would give each VM 1 core (if not over-committing as should be done) and 32GB (realistically 31GB to leave room for hypervisor) of memory which would be sufficient.

Hypervisor host runs virtual machines. Configured virtual machine templates are built with Hashicorp Packer and provisioned using Hashicorp Terraform and configured by Ansible post-provision. Virtual machines fall into two groups: base infrastructure nodes (called <code>vb</code> nodes) and service infrastructure nodes (called <code>vs</code> nodes).
