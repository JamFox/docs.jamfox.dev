[**👨‍💻 DevOps**](content/devops/index.md) - General technical system administration and devops documentation.

[**🍲 Food & Drinks**](content/food/index.md) - Anything related to food, drinks, cooking and recipes.

[**🔗 Links**](content/links/index.md) - Links of all shapes and sizes, from interesting stuff I have found to other documentation.

[**Extras**](content/extras/index.md) - Other miscellaneous stuff.
