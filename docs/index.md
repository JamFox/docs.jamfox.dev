# Welcome to JamFox's documentation

Here lies a centralized site for documentation, notes and anything else that does not fit on my personal page at [**jamfox.dev**](https://jamfox.dev)

## Bird's-eye Overview

[**HomeLab**](content/homelab/overview.md) - Anything directly related to the homelab infrastructure.

[**DevOps**](content/versioncontrol/semver.md) - General technical system administration and devops documentation.

[**Links**](content/links/essays.md) - Links of all shapes and sizes, from interesting stuff I have found to other documentation.

[**Extras**](content/extras/resources.md) - Other miscellaneous stuff.
