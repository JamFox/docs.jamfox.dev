# Welcome to JamFox's documentation

Here lies a centralized site for documentation, notes and anything else that does not fit on my personal page at [jamfox.dev](https://jamfox.dev).

## Bird's-eye Overview

**HomeLab** - Anything directly related to the homelab infrastructure.

**DevOps** - General technical system administration and devops documentation.

**Links** - Links of all shapes and sizes, from interesting stuff I have found to other documentation.

**Extras** - Other miscellaneous stuff.
