## 10 commandments of IT

1. You are replaceable at work, but you are not replaceable at home
2. Users lie
3. Fridays are read-only
4. Under-promise, over-deliver
5. Test your backups
6. Poor planning on a user's part does not constitute an emergency on ours
7. Cover your ass; if you think it's going to be a disaster, get it in writing
8. It's always DNS
9. Are you certain it is plugged in?
10. Reboot; if it still doesn't work, reboot again.
