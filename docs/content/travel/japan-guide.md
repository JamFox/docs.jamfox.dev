[How to Spend 14 Days in JAPAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBVAAnq1dHo) - Abroad in Japan

In Tokyo the train stations are coded like JY01 JY02 etc because the Japanese names are so long. when you use google maps keep an eye out for that. There’s a learning curve but once you get it you’ll always take the train. One thing about this though, if you ask a random stranger on the street how to get to a train station by its code there's a high chance they won't know what you mean.

There are express trains when you go to and from the airport. Some of them you need to get extra tickets (besides the Suica card)

Get cash for shopping and refilling suica etc

If you have iPhone. Get the Suica card on the Apple wallet because it’s hard to charge physical cards with credit cards.

Download google translate download Japanese and you can translate any Japanese words with the camera on.

Try to learn a bit of Japanese. People generally know English, but they'll rake you over the coals for a bit before they realize they're not getting anywhere.

General places:

- Watch a godzilla movie in theaters
- Mount Fuji, different routes, front is shielded from winds, back is not, so it's colder. But front is more crowded.
- traditional onsen
- arcades

## Cities

### Tokyo

Places:

- Takao mountain and surrounding area with parks, lakes, nature: (Kristen soovitas!)
- Omoide Yokocho - Maze of narrow alleyways with bars and restaurants
- Golden Gai - Similar to Omoide, but more cyberpunkish, more verticality. Kind of a tourist trap, expensive.
- [piss alley](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/japan/articles/a-guide-to-tokyos-piss-alley)
- Day trip destinations: Kamakura/Enoshima, Hakone (There's an onsen there you can book for an hour with private pools that look out over the mountain. There's also a gorgeous cedar grove on the shores of the lake. On a clear day, you can see Mt. Fuji from the lakeside.), or Takao-san
- [jazz kissaten](https://bento.com/dbinx/r-jazz.html), My absolute favorite kissaten in Tokyo is Cafe Edinburgh in Shinjuku 3-chome. It's on the second floor above a Family Mart right outside one of the Metro exits. If you go, get the morning set. The coffee and toast are divine.
- Ghibli museum
- Asahi Building
- Ramen Museum
- The National Museum
- Edo-Tokyo museum
- [Hamamonyo's shop](https://www.hamamonyo.jp/english/shops). They sell tenugui - small cloth towel. 
- Maid Cafe/other cafes, Cat Cafe, robot/Heavy Metal like bar
- Arcades
- parks, Ueno park
- big shopping areas like Ginza and Omote Sendo are like big Fashion Valley malls. So neat if you want to shop big brands but not particularly interesting or novel.
- If you're into fashion, you should check out Shimokitazawa. Lots of vintage and thrifting.
- [Aoyama Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aoyama_Cemetery) - the serenity.
- [Nihonbashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihonbashi) and ['kilometer zero'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre_zero#Japan) on that bridge - to feel the weight of history and brashness of modern day construction practice that put a highway above it. The area used to be the starting point of major travel routes, including [the one that went all the way to Kyoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/53_Stations_of_the_T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D). What is believed to be [the first department store in Japan](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/nihombashi-mitsukoshi-enjoy-history-architecture-and-personal-shopping-at-this-long-standing-store/) is nearby.
- [Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building Observatory](https://www.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/english/offices/observat.html) is free and you get a great view of Tokyo!
- [Team Labs](https://planets.teamlab.art/tokyo/) in Toyosu. It's like an interactive art exhibit that you walk through.
- Shibuya Sky when you're in Shibuya: https://www.shibuya-scramble-square.com/sky/

The ['Delta' area](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Kamogawa_Delta), from which you can take a short walk up to [Shimogamo Shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimogamo_Shrine) through a [small primeval forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadasu_no_Mori), or the Sanjo~Shijo area where [people sit along the bank while keeping equal distance between each group automagically](https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/276875/1/forma.2022.003.001.pdf).
