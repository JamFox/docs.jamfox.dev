## Leveling Up

Leveling up in NRZ has a some general rules as to how payouts are made in events:

- Circuit events tend to offer higher payouts compared to other event types.  
- Maintaining a higher average speed during events results in better rewards.  
- Finishing in higher placements, such as 1st place, increases payouts.  
- Multiplayer races provide more rewards than singleplayer. However, for grinding purposes, the waiting time for multiplayer races may reduce overall efficiency even with higher payouts.
- Achieving a perfect start provides slightly better rewards.
- Ramming/destroying more cops in Team Escapes or Pursuits will net higher rewards.

Lemans is a highly efficient event for leveling up, especially for players below Level 40. However, its efficiency decreases significantly after Level 60.

Example Lemans payouts at level 95 with S2 Class car:

- Average REP: ~34,482 per minute
- Average Cash: ~56,724 per minute

To illustrate Lemans efficiency here are the stats after Prestige 1 when my level was reset to Level 1:

- Levelskipped from Level 1 to Level 28: Using the FXX-K for 28 minutes during a 2x weekend (without the +50% boost), 23,212 REP and 149,411 cash.  
- Levelskipped from Level 28 to Level 65: Using the Bolide for 28 minutes during a 2x weekend (with the +50% boost), 326,571 REP and 774,225 cash.  
- Levelskipped from Level 65 to Level 68: Using La Voiture Noire for 28 minutes during a 2x weekend (with the +50% boost), 726,382 REP and 1,528,078 cash.  

City Perimeter is the highest-paying events after Lemans efficieny drops off after Level 60. Its high efficiency is due to the track's design, which allows for maintaining high average speeds. Example City Perimeter payouts at level 95 with S2 Class car:

- Average REP: ~53,500 per minute
- Average Cash: ~109,000 per minute

Another good choice is High Stakes, but because it's a pursuit, the rewards vary depending on how many police cars you ram or destroy during the event. Example High Stakes payouts at level 95 with S2 Class car:

- Average REP: ~41,600–70,240 per minute
- Average Cash: ~41,600–70,240 per minute

## Driving Techniques

Mastering advanced driving techniques can give you an edge in races/challenges and improve your consistency.

### Perfect Start

[Perfect Start](https://nfsworld.fandom.com/wiki/Perfect_Start) isn't a technique per se, but still a crucial part in all races. It is a shot of Nitrous available at the start of a race. In order to activate it, players must rev the engine and position the RPM inside the green zone on the RPM indicator on the bottom right-hand side of the screen. Racing without the maximum perfect start duration Skill Mod will handicap you.

Achieving a perfect start provides slightly better rewards and will give you a massive early advantage in races.

A perfect start is not a power-up and is unaffected by other nitrous Skill Mods.

### Breakturning

Unlike in other racing games, in a lot of scenarios it makes sense to turn while breaking in order to make the turn radius tighter.

### Wall Bounce/Wall Tap

This technique involves lightly hitting a wall before a corner to strategically lose grip and tighten your turning radius. While effective in some situations, it is inconsistent and requires precision to execute properly.

### Wallriding

Wallriding is generally not worth using as a primary tactic. However, in certain scenarios, it may the best viable strategy. In some other scenarious it can help with consistency, as there is nothing more consistent than just letting the wall do all the work :P

## Vinyls

For managing vinyls, you can use the Vinyl Manager in order to save your designs to `.svs` files and import other `.svs` files. `.svs` files are the best method of archiving designs or transferring designes between servers. Access Vinyl Manager through the following link:

## Best Cars

The following is a breakdown of the best cars in each class **in my biased opinion**. Note that I tend to prefer technical cars and races and I am not an incredible driver (I tend to complete any challenge that [NFSWFR](https://www.youtube.com/@NFSWFRvideos) rates equal or lower than 9). Each car's specialty, recommended performance parts, difficulty, and additional notes are listed where available.
