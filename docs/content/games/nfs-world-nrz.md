# Need for Speed World NRZ Guide

Need for Speed World NRZ (NightRiderz) is a fan-made revival of the classic Need for Speed World, offering players an enhanced experience with new features, events, and customization options. This guide is designed to help both new and experienced players navigate the game, maximize their rewards, and master advanced techniques also gives me a place to put notes and interesting information.

## Starter redeem codes

Redeem in [nightriderz.world](https://nightriderz.world/) from `Profile Icon > 'Redeem Code'`

- `YTBR-MRJC-KYT1-3DG9`: Toyota Supra + $500k
- `YTBE-LPR1-PP3R-24GG`: Viper SRT 10 - Elite Edition
- `MZA5-J6ZE-LPRI-PPER`: 4500 SpeedBoost (Must be under level 10)

## Leveling Up

Leveling up in NRZ has a some general rules as to how payouts are made in events:

- Circuit events tend to offer higher payouts compared to other event types.  
- Maintaining a higher average speed during events results in better rewards.  
- Finishing in higher placements, such as 1st place, increases payouts.  
- Multiplayer races provide more rewards than singleplayer. However, for grinding purposes, the waiting time for multiplayer races may reduce overall efficiency even with higher payouts.
- Achieving a perfect start provides slightly better rewards.
- Ramming/destroying more cops in Team Escapes or Pursuits will net higher rewards.


### Most efficient event for under level 60

Lemans is a highly efficient event for leveling up, especially for players below Level 40. However, its efficiency decreases significantly after Level 60.

Example Lemans payouts at level 95 with S2 Class car:

- Average REP: ~34,482 per minute
- Average Cash: ~56,724 per minute

To illustrate Lemans efficiency here are the stats after Prestige 1 when my level was reset to Level 1:

- Levelskipped from Level 1 to Level 28: Using the FXX-K for 28 minutes during a 2x weekend (without the +50% boost), 23,212 REP and 149,411 cash.  
- Levelskipped from Level 28 to Level 65: Using the Bolide for 28 minutes during a 2x weekend (with the +50% boost), 326,571 REP and 774,225 cash.  
- Levelskipped from Level 65 to Level 68: Using La Voiture Noire for 28 minutes during a 2x weekend (with the +50% boost), 726,382 REP and 1,528,078 cash.

So with three Lemans races over 1.5h it is possible to go from Level 1 to Level 68. Compare that to normal gameplay where one can reach around Level 42-49 after 100-300 events (6-10h of gameplay) over a much longer timeframe (examples from a couple friends).

### Most efficient event for over level 60

City Perimeter is the highest-paying events after Lemans efficieny drops off after Level 60. Its high efficiency is due to the track's design, which allows for maintaining high average speeds. Example City Perimeter payouts at level 95 with S2 Class car:

- Average REP: ~53,500 per minute
- Average Cash: ~109,000 per minute

### The most fun event for leveling

Another good choice is High Stakes, but because it's a Team Escape, the rewards vary depending on how many police cars you ram or destroy during the event. Example High Stakes payouts at level 95 with S2 Class car:

- Average REP: ~41,600–70,240 per minute
- Average Cash: ~41,600–70,240 per minute

Team Escapes in general are quite good and offer better variety and fun for grinding. Underground is another good Team Escape for leveling. Coast Chase is also a good candidate, since it offers more cops to destroy per distance travelled, but is quite a bit longer and harder.

## Driving Techniques

Mastering advanced driving techniques can give you an edge in races/challenges and improve your consistency.

### Perfect Start

[Perfect Start](https://nfsworld.fandom.com/wiki/Perfect_Start) isn't a technique per se, but still a crucial part in all races. It is a shot of Nitrous available at the start of a race. In order to activate it, players must rev the engine and position the RPM inside the green zone on the RPM indicator on the bottom right-hand side of the screen. Racing without the maximum perfect start duration Skill Mod will handicap you.

Achieving a perfect start provides slightly better rewards and will give you a massive early advantage in races.

A perfect start is not a power-up and is unaffected by other nitrous Skill Mods.

### Removing props

There are numerous props scattered throughout the game world, such as road signs, bushes, posts, flower pots, and bus stations, which add detail to the environment. However, colliding with almost any of these props will slow you down, even if the effect is subtle.

To minimize the impact of props, configuring your graphics settings correctly is, funnily enough, not straightforward. Avoid using the preset option presets "Minimum," "High," or "Ultra." Instead, opt for "Low" or "Medium" settings, as these remove the largest number of props from the game. While it might seem logical to assume that the "World Details" setting alone controls the number of props, this is not entirely accurate. Using a custom settings preset can inadvertently reintroduce props into the game: for the best results, stick to the recommended "Low" or "Medium" presets.

### Breakturning

Unlike in other racing games, in a lot of scenarios it makes sense to turn while breaking in order to make the turn radius tighter.

### Wall Bounce/Wall Tap

This technique involves lightly hitting a wall before a corner to strategically lose grip and tighten your turning radius. While effective in some situations, it is inconsistent and requires precision to execute properly.

### Wallriding

Wallriding is generally not worth using as a primary tactic. However, in certain scenarios, it may the best viable strategy. In some other scenarious it can help with consistency, as there is nothing more consistent than just letting the wall do all the work :P

## Vinyls

For managing vinyls, you can use the Vinyl Manager in order to save your designs to `.svs` files and import other `.svs` files. `.svs` files are the best method of archiving designs or transferring designes between servers. Access Vinyl Manager through the following link:  
[Vinyl Manager - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sAMRmmkqOdzbLnFalcst5KKQ-rW52V7R)

## Best Cars

The following is a breakdown of the best cars in each class **in my biased opinion**. Note that I tend to prefer technical cars and races and I am not an incredible driver (I tend to complete any challenge that [NFSWFR](https://www.youtube.com/@NFSWFRvideos) rates equal or lower than 9). Each car's specialty, recommended performance parts, difficulty, and additional notes are listed where available.
