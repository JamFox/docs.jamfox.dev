## Wasabi Mayo Beef Tacos 

From [Gordon Ramsay](https://youtu.be/fETZCWvzkWM).

!!! abstract inline "Ingredients"
    - 2 beef sirloin steaks
    - 6-8 small tortillas, to serve
    - 2 tablespoons light miso paste (aka soybean paste)
    - 2 tablespoons mirin (aka aji-mirin) or rice wine
    - 1/2 head of Chinese cabbage, finely shredded
    - 1 or 1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar or lemon juice
    - 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
    - 1 teaspoon dried chile flakes
    - 1/2 teaspoon wasabi (depending on wasabi at hand), to taste
    - 2 heaping tablespoons mayonnaise

**Instructions:**

1. Set the pan on high with some olive oil.
2. Season the steaks with salt and pepper, lay away from you on to the pan, and sear while giving the occasional shake to avoid sticking, 2-3 minutes on each side for rare/medium-rare, or until cooked to your liking. Render the fat by tipping the steaks onto their sides and cooking until the fat is golden and crisp, keep basting the steaks as you cook.
3. While searing, mix the miso paste, mirin or rice wine, sugar, and olive oil, stirring well to dissolve the sugar. Season with salt and pepper and add a tablespoon of water if the mixture needs loosening a little.
4. Slice the fat off and slip the steaks into the marinade.
5. Meanwhile, prepare the quick pickled cabbage. Put the Chinese cabbage in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add the rice vinegar, sesame oil, and chile flakes. Toss the mixture to coat, then leave to soften slightly for a couple of minutes.
6. Meanwhile, mix together the wasabi and mayonnaise, taste, and add a little more wasabi if you like a stronger flavor.
7. Heat the tortillas for 30-60 seconds over a naked gas flame until charred and lightly toasted. Roll them around a rolling pin while they're still hot, and hold until cooled to set in half-moon taco shapes.
8. Drain the beef of any excess marinade, then slice and place in the tacos. Top with the cabbage and a little wasabi mayo.

## Arayes

From [You're Probably Sleeping on Arayes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K45Fr4gXyM) by Internet Shaquille.

!!! abstract "Ingredients"
    - 1 medium onion
    - 1 bunch of parsley
    - 2 garlic cloves
    - 450g ground beef (lower fat content is better)
    - Kofta/kaftah spice mix
    - pita (tortillas work less well)

!!! abstract "Alternative to Kofta/kaftah Spice Mix Ingredients"
    - 1/2 tsp cumin
    - 1/2 tsp coriander
    - 1 tsp paprika
    - 1 tsp black pepper
    - 1 tbsp seven spice / baharat mix

!!! abstract "Alternative to Seven Spice / Baharat Mix Ingredients"
    - 2 tbsp allspice
    - 1 1/2 tbsp cumin
    - 1 tbsp coriander
    - 2 tsp cloves
    - 2 tsp nutmeg
    - 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
    - 1 tsp black pepper

**Notes:**

- It's essentially kofta, but in between a carb, like a pita or a tortilla, giving the change to mix it up a bit.
- The spice mix is the base of this dish, so it's important to get it right.
- Moisture is a problem for this dish, but it wants to be crispy, grilled rather than juicy or, god forbid, soggy. How much you squeeze out of the onion-parsley, how much fat is in the beef and what kind of cooking method you use are all important.
- I think there is a fresh component missing. Experiment and see what you like. Classic tortilla recipes provide good inspiration with cheese, tomato, lettuce, etc, but they feel a little at odds with the nature of indian spices.

**Instructions:** 

1. Cut onion into quarters and put into food processor with garlic.
2. Remove stems from parsley and add to food processor.
3. Process until homogenous and then take out and squeeze out excess moisture.
4. Add ground beef and spice mix to food processor and process until homogenous (Add salt if your spice mix doesn't already have enough!).
5. Even after squeezing out the moisture and using lower fat beef, the mixture will still be quite wet, but that's what you want. 
6. Cut pita in half and stuff the mixture in between the halves.
7. Brush the outside of the pita with olive oil.
8. Slap them in a charcoal grill, or on a cast iron pan on the stove on medium heat (coals white with grill), or 200C oven until crispy and browned.
