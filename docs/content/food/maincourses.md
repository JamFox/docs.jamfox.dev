## Wasabi Mayo Beef Tacos

From [Gordon Ramsay](https://youtu.be/fETZCWvzkWM).

!!! abstract inline "Ingredients"
    - 2 beef sirloin steaks
    - 6-8 small tortillas, to serve
    - 2 tablespoons light miso paste (aka soybean paste)
    - 2 tablespoons mirin (aka aji-mirin) or rice wine
    - 1/2 head of Chinese cabbage, finely shredded
    - 1 or 1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar or lemon juice
    - 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
    - 1 teaspoon dried chile flakes
    - 1/2 teaspoon wasabi (depending on wasabi at hand), to taste
    - 2 heaping tablespoons mayonnaise

**Instructions:**

1. Set the pan on high with some olive oil.
2. Season the steaks with salt and pepper, lay away from you on to the pan, and sear while giving the occasional shake to avoid sticking, 2-3 minutes on each side for rare/medium-rare, or until cooked to your liking. Render the fat by tipping the steaks onto their sides and cooking until the fat is golden and crisp, keep basting the steaks as you cook.
3. While searing, mix the miso paste, mirin or rice wine, sugar, and olive oil, stirring well to dissolve the sugar. Season with salt and pepper and add a tablespoon of water if the mixture needs loosening a little.
4. Slice the fat off and slip the steaks into the marinade.
5. Meanwhile, prepare the quick pickled cabbage. Put the Chinese cabbage in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add the rice vinegar, sesame oil, and chile flakes. Toss the mixture to coat, then leave to soften slightly for a couple of minutes.
6. Meanwhile, mix together the wasabi and mayonnaise, taste, and add a little more wasabi if you like a stronger flavor.
7. Heat the tortillas for 30-60 seconds over a naked gas flame until charred and lightly toasted. Roll them around a rolling pin while they're still hot, and hold until cooled to set in half-moon taco shapes.
8. Drain the beef of any excess marinade, then slice and place in the tacos. Top with the cabbage and a little wasabi mayo.

## Arayes

From [You're Probably Sleeping on Arayes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K45Fr4gXyM) by Internet Shaquille.

!!! abstract "Ingredients"
    - 1 medium onion
    - 1 bunch of parsley
    - 2 garlic cloves
    - 450g ground beef (lower fat content is better)
    - Kofta/kaftah spice mix
    - pita (tortillas work less well)

!!! abstract "Alternative to Kofta/kaftah Spice Mix Ingredients"
    - 1/2 tsp cumin
    - 1/2 tsp coriander
    - 1 tsp paprika
    - 1 tsp black pepper
    - 1 tbsp seven spice / baharat mix

!!! abstract "Alternative to Seven Spice / Baharat Mix Ingredients"
    - 2 tbsp allspice
    - 1 1/2 tbsp cumin
    - 1 tbsp coriander
    - 2 tsp cloves
    - 2 tsp nutmeg
    - 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
    - 1 tsp black pepper

**Notes:**

- It's essentially kofta, but in between a carb, like a pita or a tortilla, giving the change to mix it up a bit.
- The spice mix is the base of this dish, so it's important to get it right.
- Moisture is a problem for this dish, but it wants to be crispy, grilled rather than juicy or, god forbid, soggy. How much you squeeze out of the onion-parsley, how much fat is in the beef and what kind of cooking method you use are all important.
- I think there is a fresh component missing. Experiment and see what you like. Classic tortilla recipes provide good inspiration with cheese, tomato, lettuce, etc, but they feel a little at odds with the nature of indian spices.

**Instructions:**

1. Cut onion into quarters and put into food processor with garlic.
2. Remove stems from parsley and add to food processor.
3. Process until homogenous and then take out and squeeze out excess moisture.
4. Add ground beef and spice mix to food processor and process until homogenous (Add salt if your spice mix doesn't already have enough!).
5. Even after squeezing out the moisture and using lower fat beef, the mixture will still be quite wet, but that's what you want.
6. Cut pita in half and stuff the mixture in between the halves.
7. Brush the outside of the pita with olive oil.
8. Slap them in a charcoal grill, or on a cast iron pan on the stove on medium heat (coals white with grill), or 200C oven until crispy and browned.

## Creamy Chiken Soup

From: https://www.melskitchencafe.com/creamy-chicken-soup/

!!! abstract "Ingredients"
    - 1 teaspoon olive oil
    - about 3-4 medium carrots
    - about 3 stalks celery
    - 1 small/medium onion
    - 1L chicken broth (either low sodium, or add less salt)
    - 2 cubes chicken bouillon or 1 tablespoon chicken bouillon paste
    - 3 bay leaves
    - 1 tablespoon dried parsley
    - 1 ½ teaspoons herbs de provence
    - 1 teaspoon turmeric
    - ½ teaspoon garlic powder or 2-3 cloves garlic, finely minced
    - ½ teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
    - 0.75L milk or half-and-half or a combo
    - about 400g chopped chiken
    - Shredded parmesan, asiago or gruyere cheese, for topping (optional)

!!! abstract "Roux"
    - 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
    - 6 tablespoons butter

**Instructions:**

1. For the soup, in a 4-quart or larger saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the carrots, celery and onion. Pour in the broth and add the chicken bouillon, bay leaves, parsley, herbs de provence, turmeric, garlic powder, and pepper. Stir to combine.
2. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook, uncovered or partially covered, for 12-15 minutes until the vegetables are tender.
3. For the roux, while the soup simmers, in a small saucepan, add the olive oil and butter and cook on medium heat until the butter is melted. Add the flour and whisk to combine until a smooth paste forms. Remove from the heat.
4. Add the milk (and/or half-and-half) to the soup and heat through. Add the roux to the soup and cook, stirring or whisking constantly, over medium heat until the soup thickens and gently simmers, 5-7 minutes.
5. Stir in the chicken, season to taste with salt and pepper (this is important for flavor!) and heat through.
6. Remove the bay leaves and serve with a sprinkle of Parmesan, asiago or gruyere on top.

**Notes:**

- Half-and-half: the more half-and-half you use, the creamier this soup will be but milk works great, too. I suggest using at least 1% or 2% (not skim).
- Bouillon: the chicken bouillon (cube, paste or granules) intensifies the overall flavor of the soup. If you leave it out, season well to taste.
- Potatoes: potatoes make a great addition to this soup. I add peeled, diced potatoes (usually Yukon gold, but any variety would work) with the broth.

## Low-Effort Miso Ramen

Partly inspired by [7 Ingredient Restaurant Style Ramen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gNIqtmYg5o) by Pro Home Cooks.

IMPORTANT! With ramen it is important to prepare noodles, broth and toppings separately, not letting the tastes blend together makes it more exciting and defined, less of soup in the end AND this way the toppings don't get soggy.

!!! abstract inline "Broth ingredients"
    - Miso paste
    - Bullion (according to meat, chicken in this case)
    - 1cm cube of ginger
    - 1-2 cloves garlic

**Broth instructions:**

1. Super finely dice or grate garlic and ginger into a pot at medium heat, let soften with some olive oil.
2. Add 2 tbsp of miso paste and caramelize for 2 minutes.
3. Add a handful of bullion at a time into the pot while sirring to emulsify the mixture.

!!! abstract inline "Noodles ingredients"
    - Ramen or egg noodles

**Noodle instructions:** Cook according to packaging, but leave a little stiffer than you normally would (according to taste, if you like your noodles in ramen to be stronger) as they will absorb some broth too anyway.

!!! abstract inline "Toppings ingredients"
    - Mushrooms (shiitake or other according to taste)
    - Bean sprouts
    - Bok Choy
    - Green onion
    - Meat according to taste, chicken in this case
    - Meat seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic powder, ground ginger, and chili powder)
    - Half boiled eggs

For toppings, feel free to leave or add things as you like.

**Topping instructions:**

- For mushrooms: add to pan with some garlic and ginger, cook at medium heat for about 5 minutes.
- For chicken: mix chiken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, ground ginger, and chili powder, cook on medium heat 5-6 minutes, until they begin to brown, then flip and cook for another 5 minutes.
- For bok choy: add to boiling water for 1 minute (don't let it get soggy), best to do this right after boiling noodles.
- For green onion: slice into small rings.
- For eggs: boil for 6 minutes and plop into cold water.

## Tacos with Rajas Con Crema

!!! abstract inline "Rajas Con Crema ingredients"
    - 3 poblano peppers
    - ¼ white onion, sliced
    - Dried oregano
    - ¼ cup heavy cream
    - ½ lime, juiced
    - Salt and pepper

**Rajas Con Crema instructions:**

1. Remove the tops and seeds from 3 poblano peppers and cut in half. Place peppers on an open flame until they turn black on the outside. Once they’re black put them in foil 10 minutes to let them rest and soften up.
2. Remove from foil and remove all the charred outside skin and slice them into strips or into bite sized pieces.
3. In a skillet add ½ white onion sliced with some olive oil and saute for about 1-2 minutes before adding your poblano peppers and some dried oregano. Let cook for a few minutes.
4. Next add ¼ cup of heavy cream and the juice of ⅓ a lime and cook for about 5 minutes or until thickened. Salt and pepper to taste.
5. Remove from skillet and place in a bowl. Set aside.

!!! abstract inline "Chiken ingredients"

1. Start by butterflying the chicken and placing it in a plastic bag.
2. In a bowl combine 2 cloves of roughly chopped garlic, the juice of 2 limes, a good shake each of white pepper, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, cayenne pepper, a few glugs of olive oil and some salt and pepper. Also you want to add a little bit of sugar because that will help with the browning later on. Whisk everything together and then put it in the bag with the chicken.
3. Remove air from the bag and massage to combine everything. Place in bowl, and put the bowl in the fridge for 1-4 hours.
4. Remove chicken from marinade and place on a ripping hot skillet. Cook until each side has browning and internal temperature reaches 165°F. Once fully cooked, cover with foil and set aside to rest.
5. Slice into bite sized slices.
