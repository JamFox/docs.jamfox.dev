### Caponata

Inspired by and adjusted from [Eggplant Caponata With Raisins](https://www.sipandfeast.com/eggplant-caponata/) (also in [video recipe form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLWvHvLrdEk)).

!!! abstract inline "Ingredients"
    - 2 pounds eggplant - cubed
    - 1 cup celery - chopped
    - 1 cup red onion - chopped
    - 1 cup pitted green olives - chopped
    - 1/4 cup indian nuts
    - 1/4 cup parsley - minced
    - 1/8 cup capers - rinsed
    - 1 (6) ounce can tomato paste or just tomatoes
    - 3/4 cup olive oil
    - 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
    - 1 Tbsp sugar or a little less
    - 1 tsp kosher salt
    - 1/2 tsp black pepper

**Notes:**

- The flavors will meld together and change the taste profile for the next day.  Of course, it can be eaten right away too!
- Before roasting you can salt the eggplant pieces for 30 minutes. The salt will release moisture from the eggplants and allow them to cook quicker in the oven.  Using a paper towel, pat dry the eggplants with a wiping action to remove some of the salt before roasting.
- The texture of the caponata is really a personal preference. If you like it on the softer side, saute the veggies a little bit longer and/or cut them smaller.  Conversely, just cook them for a few minutes if you want the celery and onion crunch.

**Possible additions:**

- Add some zucchini to this caponata for a nice twist.
- Use 1-2 large bell peppers, cut up into bite-size chunks for added texture and flavor.
- Roast 1 cup of carrots with the eggplant for added flavor or just sear them in the pan with the onions and celery to introduce a crunchy texture.
- Saute 3-4 chopped anchovies until they melt with the celery and onion.
- Mint and basil are excellent additions!

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 425F and begin by cutting 2 pounds of eggplant into approximately 1″ cubes.
2. Place all the cut eggplant into a large glass bowl and toss with a 1/2 cup of olive oil, a tsp of kosher salt and a 1/2 tsp of black pepper.  Use enough oil to coat all the pieces.
3. On a large baking sheet (line it with parchment paper to avoid sticking) spread out the eggplant. Keep the pieces from touching and if necessary use 2 sheet pans.  Place the eggplant on the middle oven rack and roast for 25-30 minutes.
4. While the eggplant is roasting begin cutting 1 cup of celery into smallish pieces like shown.
5. Cut 1 cup of onion into half-moon strips.  You can cut the onion and celery any way you want!  Some people like a chunkier caponata while others prefer a smoother one.
6. Toast a 1/4 cup of pignoli (pine) nuts in a separate pan over medium-low heat for 5 minutes or so.  Be careful, they burn easily.  When finished toasting, remove the nuts and set them aside.
7. In a large pan saute the onion and celery for a few minutes in a 1/4 cup of olive oil over medium heat.  Again this is a preference/textural thing.  If you like crunchy vegetables in your caponata only saute them for a minute or so.
8. Add in one 6-ounce can of tomato paste and cook for 3 minutes longer, spreading the paste all around the pan.
9. After 25-30 minutes the eggplant will be nicely roasted as shown.  Use a fork and make sure they are soft on the inside and fully cooked.  If not, another 5 minutes in the oven is fine.
10. To the pan add 1 cup of pitted good quality green olives, an 1/8 cup of rinsed capers  Also, add 1 Tbsp of sugar and a 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar.  Cook for 5 minutes stirring occasionally to avoid sticking.
11. Add in the eggplant and pine nuts and cook for 3 more minutes to ensure the caponata is well mixed.  Be careful while mixing in the eggplant to avoid mashing it too much.  A gentle stir with a wooden spoon is all that’s required.
12. Finally, add a 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley, give it one more stir, and a taste test.  Adjust salt, pepper, and sugar if necessary.  If satisfied, let it cool, then place it in a container and refrigerate.
