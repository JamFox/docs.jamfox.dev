## Mighty breakfast apple sandwich

!!! abstract inline "Ingredients"
    - Baguette or equivalent
    - Neutral cheddar cheese
    - Bacon
    - Cayenne pepper
    - Egg
    - Soy sauce
    - Onion flakes
    - Japanese mayonnaise
    - Apple

**Notes:**

- The bacon is optional and it is very is for it to overpower the taste balance so use it very sparingly.
- Depending on the onion flakes, these can be quite strong in taste as well. When used with the bacon, be careful as these two can bring too much of this salty sting into the tastes.

**Instructions:**

1. Slap some butter on the pan, toast the bread from one side until golden brown.
2. Turn the bread over and add slices of cheese as the other side goldens. 
3. Remove bread from pan, turn the heat up slightly and add bacon seasoned with cayenne pepper.
4. When there are slight signs of char on the bacon remove on to paper towels to drain excess fat and keep them crispy.
5. Turn the heat down to medium, add the egg with a splash of soy sauce, cook and flip until the egg is cooked to your liking.
6. Add the egg on top of the cheese that is on the bread, then break the bacon into pieces and add on top of the egg.
7. Draw squiggles of Japanese mayonnaise on the bread, add a sprinkle of onion flakes and top with about 3mm apple slices.
8. Et voilà!

## Croque Monsieur

Cheese on a toast, but make it advanced.

!!! abstract inline "Bechamel Ingredients"
    - 1 Tbsp butter
    - 1 Tbsp all purpose flour
    - 1 cup milk

**Bechamel Instructions:**

1. In a saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until it stops spattering, the stage right before browning. Make sure to swirl regularly, almost constantly.
2. At this point, add 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour and whisk into a thick paste and cook for 2-3 minutes until the raw flour dissipates.
3. At which point, slowly add 1 cup of cold milk by adding in stages.
4. Once the cup of milk has been added and there are no lumps in the corners, continue cooking for 5-7 minutes until nice and thick.
5. Season with pepper, and a generous pinch of kosher salt.
6. Whisk to combine and cook for 1 minute until it’s thick enough to run down, but still coat the back of a spoon.
7. Cover and allow to cool for 10-15 minutes before sandwich assembly.

!!! abstract inline "Croque Monsieur Ingredients"
    - Bechamel
    - Brioche bread
    - Gruyere or Raclette cheese (or both), shredded
    - Slices of ham
    - Dijon mustard

1. Start by toasting two pieces of brioche bread then shred some of the cheese. Spread a couple of tablespoons worth of the bechamel on the bottom slice of the bread, just enough to cover it.
2. Top that with a generous amount of cheese along with slices of ham, topping with another generous amount of gruyere, spreading the top slice of bread with dijon mustard before placing on top.
3. Spread another layer of bechamel on top of the sandwich and another layer of cheese.
4. Place into a broiler or oven until thoroughly brown and bubbly.
5. Et voilà!

## Undercover Tuna Dip

Sneak this next to the chips in a small bowl and watch as people unsuspectingly try and start loving it. Works best without telling people that it has tuna inside to avoid suspicions and hesitation, because the concept doesn't *seem* super appetizing, but will surely be devoured if anyone gets a taste.

    - 1 can of tuna fillet in oil
    - 2-3 tsp Hellmann's (or other neutral) mayonnaise
    - Juice of half of a lemon

2. Et voilà!
