    - 1 Tbsp butter
    - 1 Tbsp all purpose flour
    - 1 cup milk

**Bechamel Instructions:**

1. In a saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until it stops spattering, the stage right before browning. Make sure to swirl regularly, almost constantly.
2. At this point, add 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour and whisk into a thick paste and cook for 2-3 minutes until the raw flour dissipates.
3. At which point, slowly add 1 cup of cold milk by adding in stages.
4. Once the cup of milk has been added and there are no lumps in the corners, continue cooking for 5-7 minutes until nice and thick.
5. Season with pepper, and a generous pinch of kosher salt.
6. Whisk to combine and cook for 1 minute until it’s thick enough to run down, but still coat the back of a spoon.
7. Cover and allow to cool for 10-15 minutes before sandwich assembly.
