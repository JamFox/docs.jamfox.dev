## Undercover Tuna Dip

Sneak this next to the chips in a small bowl and watch as people unsuspectingly try and start loving it. Works best without telling people that it has tuna inside to avoid suspicions and hesitation, because the concept doesn't *seem* super appetizing, but will surely be devoured if anyone gets a taste.

    - 1 can of tuna fillet in oil
    - 2-3 tsp Hellmann's (or other neutral) mayonnaise
    - Juice of half of a lemon

**Instructions:**

1. Combine everything and season with salt to taste.
2. Et voilà!

    - 3 small ripe avocados
    - 1 clove fresh garlic
    - 1/2 small red onion, minced
    - 1 lime
    - 1 tsp toasted and freshly ground cumin
    - Freshly ground pepper
    - 1/2 jalapeño, finely choped
    - 2 Tbsp cilantro, finely chopped

**Notes:**

- Feeling funky? Add some banana, about 1/4 to 1/3 of a banana per 3 avocados depending on the size (Thanks, Ere!).

**Instructions:**

1. In a medium bowl, combine 3 small ripe avocados, 1 clove of crushed garlic, 1/2 of a small minced red onion, the juice from 1 lime, 1 teaspoon of toasted and freshly ground cumin, a pinch of kosher salt, a few twists of freshly ground pepper, 1/2 of a finely chopped jalapeño, and 2 finely chopped tablespoons of cilantro.  
2. Using a fork, mash the combination together until it is relatively smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and cover with plastic wrap, making sure to press it down directly onto the surface to prevent browning. Place in the refrigerator for later.
3. Et voilà!
