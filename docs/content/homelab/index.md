Anything directly related to the homelab infrastructure is documented in this section.

!!! info
    A [homelab](https://old.reddit.com/r/homelab/) is self-hosted infrastructure at home for:

    - experimenting in a safe environment and learning technologies.
    - running personal "production" services (like game servers, file cloud etc).

Latest full list of hardware used in the homelab is available on my personal site's [Setup page]([content/homelab/hardware.md](https://jamfox.dev/setup)). Other sections in documentation may only reference bits and pieces of the setup.
