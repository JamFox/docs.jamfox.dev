### Useful gamerules

Set how many players have to be sleeping to skip a night: `/gamerule playersSleepingPercentage 30`

To keep inventory after dying: `/gamerule keepInventory true`

To keep XP after death: `/gamerule keepXPAfterDeath true`

Add a stat to scoreboard (seen on TAB press), for example number of deaths:

```
/scoreboard objectives add Death_Counter deathCount
/scoreboard objectives setdisplay list Death_Counter
```
